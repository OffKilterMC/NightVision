# Night Vision

Mod for Minecraft.

Ever wanted to enable night vision with the press of a key? Now you can. This mod effectively enables the same night vision lightmaps as the Night Vision effect.

It's completely client-side and as such requires no server install.

This is an incredibly helpful mod if you just want to mess around in Creative mode and fly through the world in spectator or using creative no-clip from the Carpet mod. It allows you to just push the hotkey and you can see the entire cave network. Obviously, this isn't recommended for normal play!

The hotkey is set in the Controls settings under Miscellaneous. The default key is N.

Known Conflicts/Issues:
- This mod will not function properly with shaders such as BSL, as they bypass the lightmap code that NightVision deal with.
